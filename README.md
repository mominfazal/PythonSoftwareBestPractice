# Software Development Best Practice using Python
This is just a simple Repo containing links to clear some of the most important concepts of python which can help you become better developer.

In case you are starting with python, then I would suggest go through the whole course of [MIT - 6.001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) . Don't cheat. Solve each assignments. 

This repo and its contents are created by referencing MITs 6.005 Software Construction course in Java. However, the aim is to gather best Python documents available on the internet for understanding the same concepts using Python quickly.

Lets get started. I suggest running the code examples using [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/)

1) [Static Typing by Adam Geitgey](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/learn-how-to-use-static-type-checking-in-python-3-6-in-10-minutes-12c86d72677b):
    Understand the use of variable types to avoid unexpected code failures.

2) [Documenting Python Code](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/):
    Understand the various types of code documentation which can help code reader to understand your code easily.

3) [DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself](https://scientificallysound.org/2018/07/19/python-functions/):
    Understand the importance of functions for improving reusability of the system.

4) [Fail Fast](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/):
    Understand the coolest way to ensure your code fails if it is unable to do what it is suppose to do.

5) [Magic Number](https://github.com/mominfazal/PythonSoftwareBestPractice/blob/master/poor_magic_number.py):
    Ensuring your logic and some of the default parameters in your logic is self explainable to the reader.

6) [Reduce Use of global variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/484635/are-global-variables-bad):
    Understanding why the use of global variables is not advised unless necessary.

7) [Immutability in Python](https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747):
    Understanding the simple yet important concept of python immutable and mutable objects, also understand how it works when those varibales are passed to function altering those variables as parameters.

8) [Error Handling in Python](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/learning-not-to-handle-exceptions/):
    Every language has try, catch, finally blocks but its important to understand what is the best way of using the exception handling technique in python to ensure robust code. Also look for using using assert in python.

9) [Incremental development in Python](https://dfrieds.com/python/incremental-development):
    Understanding moving with development step by step is really important. To avoid bugs and consider all the possibilties while coding we must use incremental approach.

10) [Modularity in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-code-reuse-modularity-python-3/)
    Understanding the importance of classes and functions to ensure code is modular and reusable.

11) [Encapsulation in Python](https://medium.com/@manjuladube/encapsulation-abstraction-35999b0a3911)
    Understanding the variable scope, abstraction and encapsulation using python.

12) [Abstraction in Python](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~pkalra/csl101/Python-ADT.pdf)
    Understanding most fundamental programming technique to make code, readable, reusable and structured using  abstraction technique.

13) [Inheritence in Python](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_inheritance.php)
    Understanding the use of inheriting some feature of a class into another class using python.
